          <p className="text-base mb-6">
            It all started with an old house, a long list of projects, and way too many trips to Home Depot.

            <p className="text-base">Like many homeowners, I found myself tackling renovationsâ€”some big, some small, some DIY, and some with contractors. Every project came with receipts, invoices, and expenses that piled up in a filing cabinet (or got lost in a drawer somewhere). When tax season rolled around, I knew some of these expenses would also qualify for credits, but tracking everything was a nightmare. I also knew the I should save these receipts as they would add to my cost basis in the event we ever sold the house in the future.</p>
            <p className="text-base">
              I searched for a tool that could organize renovation receipts, track expenses, and generate tax-friendly reports, but nothing fit my needs. So, I decided to build it myself.
