            Introducing Renovation Receipts: The Smartest Way to Track Your Home Improvement Expenses & Maximize Tax Savings

            Stop Stuffing Receipts in a Filing Cabinet ‚Äì Go Digital Instead!

            <p className="mb-6">
              If you're a homeowner, you've probably made improvements to your home‚Äîmaybe you added a new deck, replaced old windows, or finally updated that 90s kitchen. But did you know that tracking your home improvement expenses can save you thousands in taxes when you sell your home?
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-8">Most people don't. And that's where Renovation Receipts comes in.</p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">üè° What is Renovation Receipts?</h3>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Renovation Receipts is an easy-to-use web app that helps homeowners track, organize, and optimize their home improvement expenses so they can maximize their cost basis and reduce capital gains taxes when they sell.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6">
              Instead of tossing receipts into a folder (or worse, losing them completely), you can digitally log every home improvement project, store receipts & photos, and get automatic tax calculations to see how much money you're saving.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">üí° Why Should You Track Your Home Improvements?</h3>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Most homeowners forget that the money they put into their home can actually reduce their tax bill later. When you sell your home, the IRS allows you to increase your home's cost basis with qualifying improvements‚Äîlowering your taxable capital gains.
